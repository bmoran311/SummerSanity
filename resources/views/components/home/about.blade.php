                <p>
                    We met in daycare, bonded by inconsistent sleep but consistent childcare schedules. But once our kids hit elementary school, summer turned into a
                    chaotic, week-by-week puzzle. We ditched the clunky spreadsheets and built Summer Sanity to bring back the ease (and fun) of planning with friends.

                            Simplify summer planning for parents with a user-friendly calendar that makes it easy to coordinate with their trusted circlesâ€”because
                            summer is for fun not frustration.
