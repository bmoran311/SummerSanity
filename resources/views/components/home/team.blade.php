                        With 20 years in marketing and communications, I’ve always loved building strong messages and meaningful connections. I’m also a mom and when my
                        kids moved on from the consistency of daycare to the chaos of elementary school summers, I was totally overwhelmed. I found myself losing sleep
                        over camp registration dates, costs, pickup times, and whether my kids would see their friends. I built complicated spreadsheets and sent them
                        back and forth with friends, but it never felt like enough. I dreamed of one secure place where parents could plan together easily. With Summer
                        Sanity, that dream is finally here and this summer I’ll be spending less time in spreadsheets and more time camping with my family, enjoying the
                        beach, and catching up on my reading.

                        As a leadership coach and founder of Career Outfitters, I’ve built a business rooted in one thing: relationships. Before coaching, I spent two
                        decades in corporate roles across investment banking, technology, and risk. I’ve seen firsthand how the mental load at home impacts energy and
                        performance at work. Like so many, I went from daycare structure to summer chaos and quickly saw how lonely and logistical it all became. That’s
                        why I teamed up with my friend and fellow Megan to create Summer Sanity. This summer, I’m trading the time I used to spend in spreadsheets for
                        more hikes in Asheville & paddle boarding on Lake Wylie with my co-founder!
